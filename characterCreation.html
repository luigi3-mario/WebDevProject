			<p>Recently, I have been thinking a lot about Pokémon, and more specifically about how I would change it if I were the designer. The actual changes are  story for a different blogpost, but suffice it to say that, within a few days, I was planning my own game in the same style.</p>
			<p>As I was thinking about story elements, I realised I would need to create character designs. The main characters for Pokémon games usually have really cool designs, and I want to create something similar, but with characters that are a bit older.</p>
