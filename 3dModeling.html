			<p>While I was musing about various animation styles and trying to come up with economical ways to implement an old-school cartoony anime style in one of my games, I came across a Reddit post (which I can no longer find) where someone said that they created a pixel art character more efficiently by using a Blender model as a base. I thought &quot;Cool! maybe I could use blender to create similar characters, but without the pixelation!</p>
			<p>And with that, off I went to learn Blender. I started with blender Guru&#39;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4haAdmHqGOw">donut tutorial</a>, which is what the Reddit post recommended. Here is what I created: </p>
			<p>And with the basics down, I decided to move on to modeling my character. I looked all over for modeling tutorials, and eventually found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2_uiUEcY7w&list=PLe0O-ypJqvKw6meu68TlU0_motrjcnrva">this one by Bran Sculpts</a>. I struggled a lot with this one, and my model ended up being so ugly that I decided to start over.</a></p>
