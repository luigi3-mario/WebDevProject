    	<p>So I&#39;ve had a few ideas for board games I could make in Godot. The problem is that I don&#39;t really know that much about making games in Godot, especially board games. But after following YouTuber BornCG&#39;s very helpful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvPTSZl2WCc&list=PLda3VoSoc_TSBBOBYwcmlamF1UrjVtccZ&index=9">2D</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeCrE-ge8xM&list=PLda3VoSoc_TSBBOBYwcmlamF1UrjVtccZ">3D</a> platformer tutorials to learn the basics of Godot, I realized that he has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A60dT7RJfO8&list=PLda3VoSoc_TSBBOBYwcmlamF1UrjVtccZ&index=26">another one on how to make Memory</a>. I decided that it would be a good idea to follow that tutorial and see what I learn.</p>
    	<h2>My review</h2>
    	<p>Overall, the tutorial was quite effective and taught me a lot about Godot. It could get a bit overwhelming or boring at times, but that&#39;s nothing a healthy break can&#39;t fix. While it&#39;s designed for Godot 3.2, I was using Godot 4.x and found it mostly still worked. Overall, I highly recommend it to anyone, whether kid or adult, looking to learn Godot 3.2. If you&#39;re trying to learn Godot 4.x, this tutorial will still get the job done if you&#39;re patient.</p>
    	<p>Here&#39;s a list of topics this tutorial covers.</p>
    	<ul>
          <li>Singletons</li>
          <li>Text and Labels</li>
